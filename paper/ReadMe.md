# Supplementary Material for GSA Paper

This folder contains all information needed to reproduce results in the GSA paper 
submitted to [Open Research Europe](https://open-research-europe.ec.europa.eu/). 

## Summary

The four folders in this directory are summarised in the table below. More information 
on each folder can be found in the following sections. 

| Folder Name | Description                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| Figures     | Figures presented in the Methods     |
| Model One   | Data and results relating to Model 1 |
| Model Two   | Data and results relating to Model 2 |
| Model Two   | Data and results relating to Model 3 |

The results for each model run are included in these folders for simplicity. However, 
running the model and GSA using the supplied input data will produce the same results
presented. 

## Figures

This folder containes author created graphics presented in the paper, such as the 
flowcharts and reference energy system diagrams. Moreover, the file `Diagrams.drawio.xml` 
is included, which can be imported to [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/)
to view the source of these graphics. 

## Model One 

Model one is a single technology OSeMOSYS model, as shown below, with the directory structure 
is presneted after. 

![Model_One](./Figures/Model_1.jpg)

### Model/

Contains the model inputs and outputs as CSVs. This data is used to generate capacity
exapnsion result figures. 

### Images/ 

Images relating to model 1. These incldue capacity expansion result figures and GSA 
figures

### GSA/No_Demand/

GSA configuration files required to run Model 1 **without**  the Specified Annual 
Demand as a sensitivity parameter. Method of Morris results, generated by SALib, are 
stored in this folder.  

### GSA/With_Demand/

GSA configuration files required to run Model 1 **with**  the Specified Annual 
Demand as a sensitivity parameter. Method of Morris results, generated by SALib, are 
stored in this folder.  

### model_one.ipynb

Jupyter Notebook that generates all images shown in the `Images/` directory

## Model Two

Model two is a multi-technology OSeMOSYS model, as shown below, with the directory structure 
is presneted after. 

![Model_Two](./Figures/Model_2.jpg)

### Model/

Contains the model inputs and outputs as CSVs. This data is used to generate capacity
exapnsion result figures. Two sets of model data are stored in this folder, one which 
does not have a ModelPeriodEmissionLimit, and one that does. All other data between 
these models are the same. 

### Images/ 

Images relating to model 2. These incldue capacity expansion result figures and GSA 
figures

### GSA/No_Emission_Limit/

GSA configuration files required to run Model 2 **without**  the Emission Limit. 
Method of Morris results, generated by SALib, are stored in this folder.  

### GSA/With_Demand/

GSA configuration files required to run Model 2 **with**  the Emission Limit. 
Method of Morris results, generated by SALib, are stored in this folder.  

### model_two.ipynb

Jupyter Notebook that generates all images shown in the `Images/` directory
